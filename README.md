# Parallel-Merge-Sort
Parallel Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits an array of elements into 
two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves. This project 
aims to implement a parallel version of the merge sort algorithm using multi-threading or 
multi-processing techniques.
